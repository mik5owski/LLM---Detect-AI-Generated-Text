Model that identifies which essay was written by a large language model


In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly sophisticated, capable of generating text that is difficult to distinguish from human-written text. Develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect whether an essay was written by a student or an LLM. Dataset comprises a mix of student-written essays and essays generated by a variety of LLMs.
